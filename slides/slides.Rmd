## Excel + DST = Bad

Suppose we have a spreadsheet with some regularly-spaced times in it, spanning the "spring-ahead" EST -> EDT switch on March 11, 2018

```{r}
library(readxl)

tbl <- read_excel(example_file)
tbl
```

(looks the same in Excel)

---

Those datetimes are all 1 hour apart from those before & after; DST means 2am becomes 3am.

--

But R doesn't know that:

```{r}
diff(tbl$datetime)
```

--

Because the timezone is wrong!

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)

tbl %>% summarize_all(tz)
```

---

## Conversion

We want to keep the clock-time, while changing the underlying _instant of time_; the tool for this is `lubridate::force_tz` function (rather than `with_tz`).

```{r}
fixed <- force_tz(tbl$datetime, "EST")
fixed
```

--

Those look alright, but be careful

```{r}
diff(fixed)
```

--

"EST" is not what we want!

---

## Choose your timezone carefully!

We need to use a different timezone code. 

--

In general, we want to use location-specific names like "America/New_York" to get a proper mix of EST/EDT

```{r}
fixed <- force_tz(tbl$datetime, "America/Detroit")
fixed
```

--

```{r}
diff(fixed)
```

--

(check `OlsonNames()` to get a full list >600 codes)

---

## Three Cheers for Lubridate

Hard to overstate the importance of using `lubridate` anytime you're doing anything with dates/times (times in particular).

--

Base R can be a bit too lenient:

```{r}
x <- "2018-05-25 12:00:00"

bad <- as.POSIXct(x, "America/Fake_Town")  # not in OlsonNames()
bad
```

--

What timezone is "America"??

--

```{r}
with_tz(bad, "UTC")
```

No change in clock-time.

---

## Three Cheers for Lubridate

`lubridate` has your back!
--

```{r, error=TRUE}
as_datetime(x, "America/Fake_Town")
```

--

```{r, warning=TRUE}
good <- as_datetime(x, "America/Detroit")
with_tz(good, "America/Fake_Town")
```

--

Note the first was an _error_ and the second was a _warning_, so **be careful!**

---

## Which timezone is correct?

Because (most) of the US observes Daylight Savings time in analogous ways, these times could be from almost anywhere in the US.

--

If they came from somewhere else, switching the timezone code to match will do what you want:

```{r}
nyc <- force_tz(tbl$datetime, "America/New_York")  # still Eastern
nyc
```
--
```{r}
chi <- force_tz(tbl$datetime, "America/Chicago")  # Central
chi
```

---

## Check It

We expect even spacing now; did we get it?

--

```{r}
diff(nyc)
```
--
```{r}
diff(chi)
```
--
Good!

---

## Writing to Disk

What happens when we write these out?

--

First we stick them in a table

```{r}
tbl <- tbl %>%
  mutate(nyc = nyc, chi = chi) %>%
  rename(orig = datetime)
tbl
```

--

(Notice how they all _look_ the same; `tibble` doesn't show the timezones)

---

## Writing to Disk

And write them to a CSV

```{r}
library(readr)

write_csv(tbl, "tbl.csv")
```

--

And read them back out

```{r}
# leave all as character
read_csv("tbl.csv", col_types = "ccc")
```

---

## UTC?

All the datetimes were written to the CSV as _UTC_ (Coordinated Universal Time, same as GMT)

--

UTC is like the _one true timezone_

--

**No DST BS!**

--

Programming languages generally store time as UTC; timezones only change the _display_ (printed/string representation)

---

## Date/Time Representation

R stores time as seconds-since-Unix-epoch (1970-01-01), and dates as days-since-Unix-epoch

--

```{r}
as.integer(ymd_hms("1970-01-01 00:00:00"))
```
--
```{r}
as.integer(ymd("1970-01-01"))
```
--
```{r}
as.integer(ymd("1969-01-01"))
```

---

## Date/Time Representation

Excel is a bit, uh, _weirder_:

--
- dates and times are _floats_
    - integer part is days-since-an-epoch, usually 1899-12-31 (can vary across version & platforms!)
    - time-of-day is stored as the decimal component, so 1am is 1/24...which can't be represented exactly!

--

- Excel thinks 1900 was a leap year!
    - it wasn't, but this is unlikely to ever be fixed

--

- no clear way to store-as-UTC-but-display-EST!

---

## Back to Reading

Like `readxl::read_excel`, `readr::read_csv` will read datetimes in as UTC

```{r}
new_tbl <- read_csv("tbl.csv", col_types = "TTT")
new_tbl
```
--
```{r}
new_tbl %>% summarize_all(tz)
```

---

## Back to Reading

Because R stores datetimes as UTC, this is already equivalent to the table we wrote out

--

```{r}
all_equal(tbl, new_tbl)
```

--

Even though the timezones are different!

---

## The Other Conversion

To make this new table have the timezones we had before, since these are the correct _instants of time_, we'll use `with_tz` to change how they are displayed (clock time).

```{r}
new_tbl <- new_tbl %>%
  mutate(
    nyc = with_tz(nyc, "America/New_York"),
    chi = with_tz(chi, "America/Chicago")
  )

new_tbl
```

---

## The Other Conversion

Still equal:

```{r}
all_equal(tbl, new_tbl)
```

--

**N.B**: `readr` doesn't currently let us specify timezone while reading (e.g. through `col_datetime`)

---

## with_tz vs. force_tz

An important distinction!

--
- `with_tz`:
    - _maintains_ instant-of-time, _changes_ clock-time
    - _same_ integer
    - translate _correct_ times between timezones

--

- `force_tz`:
    - _changes_ instant-of-time, _maintains_ clock-time
    - _different_ integer
    - fix non-UTC times read as UTC

---

## Not everyone loves UTC

Writing out as UTC is great for _us_, but may not be for our clients

The only way I know to write non-UTC is to convert datetime columns to `character` before writing:

```{r}
char_tbl <- mutate_all(new_tbl, as.character)
char_tbl
```

---

## Not everyone loves UTC

```{r}
write_csv(char_tbl, "char-tbl.csv")

read_csv("char-tbl.csv", col_types = "ccc") # will read as datetime by default
```

--

Notice `as.character` does a rather different POSIXct-to-string conversion than `readr::write_csv` did (which uses `readr::output_column`)

---

## Writing to Excel

While you should only write directly to Excel if _absolutely necessary_, do we get similar behavior there?

--

We'll use the `writexl` package to investigate; it's like the other half of `readxl` (modern, maintained, C-based)

```{r}
library(writexl)

# datetime & character versions
lst(tbl, char_tbl) %>% write_xlsx(path = "output.xlsx")
```

---

# Writing to Excel

proper datetimes:

```{r}
read_excel("output.xlsx")
```

---

# Writing to Excel

character version:

```{r}
read_excel("output.xlsx", sheet = 2)
```

---

# Writing to Excel

We see very similar behavior to the `readr`/CSV approach:

--
- the correct-in-R `tbl` writes out as UTC times in Excel-native date/time format
    - so we'd use `with_tz` to set timezones

--

- the string versions all display local time, but Excel sees them as strings, not dates

---

## So what do we do?

There's no clear best approach here; for both CSV and XLSX we can either

--
- give proper datetimes in UTC
    - requires a client to do some non-trivial extra work which is subject to signinficant error (e.g. EST vs. EDT)

--

- write them as less-usable but clock-correct _strings_
    - ugh?

--

**`¯\_(ツ)_/¯`**

---

## Separate Dates & Times

Excel users often store _datetimes_ as _date_ & _time_, in two different columns.

--

We can see an example in the other sheet of our example file; same data, but split across two columns. Let's read it:

--

```{r}
split_tbl <- "../excel-examples.xlsx" %>%
  read_excel(sheet = "separate")

split_tbl
```

--

There's that weird epoch!

---

## Separate Dates & Times

`readxl` read both in as `POSIXct`, UTC. (can't do date-only)

--

```{r}
split_tbl %>% summarize_all(tz)
```

---

## Separate Dates & Times

We want a single column with the date from `date` and the time from `time`.

--

There's a few ways we could do this:

--
1. set `date` of the `time` columns to be dates from `date` column
1. create a new column of `POSIXct` objects composed of the relevant bits of `date` & `time`

(probably others)

---

## Separate Dates & Times

I prefer the latter:

--

```{r}
split_tbl %>%
  mutate(datetime = ymd_hms(paste(date(date), format(time, "%T")), tz = "America/New_York"))
```

---

## Separate Dates & Times

The alternative requires an extra step for the timezone and makes for awkward code-flow:

--

```{r}
# can't figure out how to pipe this
date(split_tbl$time) <- date(split_tbl$date)

split_tbl <- split_tbl %>%
  mutate(datetime2 = force_tz(time, "America/New_York"))

split_tbl
```

---

## Separate Dates & Times

Now while `time` and `datetime2` _look_ the same, they have different timezones,

--

```{r}
split_tbl %>% select(time, datetime2) %>% summarize_all(tz)
```

--

and thus different spacing

```{r}
split_tbl %>% select(time, datetime2) %>% mutate_all(~.x - lag(.x))
```

---

## Mind The Gap

Not all times are valid!

--

```{r, warning=TRUE}
# never happened here
x <- "2018-03-11 02:30:00"

# UTC
ymd_hms(x)
```

--

We can set the timezone on conversion:

--

```{r, warning=TRUE}
ymd_hms(x, tz = "America/Detroit")
```

---

## Mind The Gap

Forcing after is the same, but _there's no warning_:

--

```{r, warning=TRUE}
ymd_hms(x) %>% force_tz("America/Detroit")
```

--

`force_tz` has a nifty `roll` arg:

```{r}
ymd_hms(x) %>% force_tz("America/Detroit", roll = TRUE)
```

--

(I haven't needed this before, and hope I never do)

---

## The Other DST Transition

"Spring Ahead" skips an hour, but "Fall Behind" _repeats_ an hour

--

In non-UTC data, we might get the same time repeated the switch

```{r}
x <- paste("2017-11-05", c("00:30:00", "01:30:00", "01:30:00", "02:30:00", "03:30:00")) # regularly spaced

ymd_hms(x, tz = "America/Detroit")
```
--
```{r}
diff(ymd_hms(x, tz = "America/Detroit"))
```

--

`lubridate` thinks both 1:30's are the _second_ one, and _I don't know what to do here_

---

## Lessons Learned

- (non-UTC) time is a special kind of hell invented by humans

--

- UTC & `lubridate` save lives

--

- clients _rarely_ provide UTC time, so post-read conversion is generally required

--

- double-check everything when reading in datetimes from anywhere!

--

- no good way to write out non-UTC times :(

--

p.s. `timezones` _can_ be set for time-free dates...but does it ever matter?
